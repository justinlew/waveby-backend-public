# waveby-backend-public
This repo serves as the backend for my social media web application using Node, Express and MongoDB. These REST APIs will be used as a boilerplate for my future projects.

Although not necessary, the frontend for Waveby is housed in the repository [Waveby](https://github.com/justinlew/waveby-react).
